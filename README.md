## excersise1 
i did these together with sicko sinds i didn't understand it right away. we fixed it by giving the function a parameter.
the same value that has to be displayed.
## excersise 2 
wrong index was given so 1 changed to 0.

## excersise 3 
wrong syntax used. wrong "" .

## excersise 4 
looked up foreacht and saw the "&"-sign and added it to the loop.

## excersise 5 
i tried changing "<=" to "<" but that excluded the "z".
i also tried <= aa but that only gave me "a" in return.
so then i tried != aa and that worked
